I made some shapes

Touch The Shapes

The shapes all feel different, as different as they look. I wanted to make more shapes, and soon I will.

Wiggle the shapes around a little. The shapes appreciate affection. 
As you wiggle the shapes, please appreciate the swirling starry sky. 

Please try not to drop the shapes off of the platform, they are afraid of heights.
